# Beeble the Babble

Beeble the Babble was a freindly beetle. Some said too friendly. See, when Beeble the Babble got talking he would go on and on. He could easily fill many hours each day happily babbling along.

Beeble's house was in the village. The pale blue house with the tile roof, three east and one north of the exact geographical center. Every morning he would get up and go for a walk. He would greet everyone he passed. Most would nod back, some would say hi and rush on, most everyone tried to not get stuck in conversation. Beeble was pleasant but they had things to do!

On a particular May morning, Beeble had walked through the entire village without striking up a conversation. Since a talk-less walk is never done, he decided to keep going.

Down his favorite path Beeble went. Past the dandelion field, through the rarely trimmed foliage, and along the river. Beeble loved this path as he could talk his head off and the river would just babble right back.

He had been walking for no longer than thirty minutes however when he heard a different voice. It wasn't the river's and it certainly was not his own.

> Help! Help!

Beeble looked around. Who was it calling out?

> Over here! In the river!

Facing the water Beeble could see a small fish floundering around and looking for all the world like he was drowning.

> I'm drowning!

Cried the fish. Well that settled that.

Beeble the Babble sprang into action. Two medium sized sticks, one strapped on each foot, a longer twig for a punt pole, and a hunk of bark on his back. Beeble pushed himself out to the center of the river, toward the small fish. Once there, he laid down the bark, helped the small fish grasp onto it, and then - with great skill - he slowly, foot by foot used his pole to move them to shallow water. Finally the fish was able to set his fins down and take a much needed break.

> Oh my. Thank you so much.

Huffed the grateful fish.

> Of course, said Beeble, But how did this happen? I thought swimming was what fish did best?

> Well yes, the small fish started, I was swimming along when I got caught up in the current and it was so much stronger than what I expected. Honestly, you saved my life. I cannot thank you enough

> No need to thank me, anyone would have done the same. As my late mama Myrtle the Babble always said, a fish to water is the most natural thing. Shocking to hear that it is not always true. I am glad I saved you of course, I have great friends who are fish and one more friend is never too much. My friend Sara by the way - she's a beautiful catfish - perhaps you know her? Although I think she lives upriver so maybe you have not been that far, she's very nice though, I met her at the River-Land Mixer. It's a wonderful event, have you been? The alderman's idea and boy is it a fun one, those river animals are just like us you know and we're just like them. They had it at the local harbor, set up a little bar half of it in the water and half of it on land. I didn't know you could even do that...

Beeble prattled on and on and the small fish listened patiently for he was very grateful. Eventually they parted ways. It was a full day's work for Beeble and he headed home.

------------

The following day he woke up with his legs still aching from balancing the previous day. He decided to take a shorter walk - no further than the outskirts of the village.

Beeble walked slowly. Past the last house to the north, beside the field where the children play, listening to their loud voices laughing and cheering. It was just as he was passing the well that he heard a new cry.

> I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Can anyone hear me?!

Beeble swiveled his head back and forth. He couldn't see anything.

> Down here! In the well!

Beeble ran over and looked down.

A young bird was sitting on a stone at the bottom. Dry, but barely above the water.

Beeble didn't hesitate. He jumped right into the hanging well bucket, grabbing the rope and - using his own grip as a counterweight - slowly, foot-by-foot, he lowered himself into the well.

> I'm coming, I'm coming!

He called into the darkness. By the time he hit bottom, Beeble's arms ached but he took hold of the young bird and started pulling. Fist-full by fist-full they went up. Pull the rope. Breathe. Pull. Breathe. A few inches at a time. *"Thank goodness I haven't been skipping arm day"* Beeble thought. Finally, shoulders quivering, they reached the top of the well and beetle and bird tumbled out onto the ground.

> Goodness, said Beeble, finally catching his breath. However did this happen? I thought flying was what birds did best.

> Well...I've been practicing flying, came the reply, I really have. But I'm a young bird and I'm great at swooping, and circling. I can coast and I can take off with a running start, but I haven't mastered flying upwards quite yet. Thank you so much for rescuing me for without you I would surely have starved. How can I ever repay you?

Beeble drew his tired body up

> No need to repay me young birdie. My mama always said that birds are like feathered angels. Have you been down by the department store in the next town over? They have a wonderful display of angels in the window. Oh I'm sorry, is it insensitive for me to mention windows? I know many birds have issues with those. Not that I'm saying that you do, we really just met, but I find windows quite helpful myself. I actually would like to have a room of my house that is entirely windows, even on the ceiling. Of course I don't think that's possible, I have a tile roof and you can't really put a skylight into tile. I suppose you could but it wouldn't look right. My friend Tara is an interior designer and I am quite sure that is what she would say...

The young bird nodded along as Beeble went on and on. When he finally wound down the bird thanked him again and flew off. Done for the day, Beeble turned around and walked slowly back.

------------

The next day, Beeble's whole body ached! Given how the last two days had gone, he thought he would just take the shortest of walks. A few blocks to get some fresh air, no more.

To no avail! for he had hardly made it ten houses - just past the pink one with the sprinklers - when he heard a sad repeated sob. Beeble spied a little boy crying on the sidewalk.

> What's the matter little boy?

Beeble asked.

> It's mother's day, came the reply, and I don't have any way to tell my mother that I love her.

As always, Beeble took charge of the situation.

> Wait right there.

And he rushed to his house and brought glue sticks and paper and scissors and colored pencils and paints and macaroni and pipe cleaners.

And he sat down with the little boy right there on the sidewalk, and they made the prettiest card. It had a drawing of the boy's mother and a macaroni heart. It had a short poem on the inside in every color of the rainbow. It had a little cut-out family that popped up as you opened the card and even a stand so that the card would stand upright on the mantle. For hours they worked putting this card together.

> Thank you so much! The boy shouted when it was complete. She's going to love it. I just can't thank you enough for helping.

> Well little boy. As my mama always told me...

Beeble the Babble drew himself up to his full height, ready to launch into a story about the time he got lost in the woods. Then he paused. He thought. He paused some more. And finally, he spoke.

> You know what, little boy? It doesn't matter what my mama told me. What matters is what you tell your mama. So take your card and run along and do what little boys do best. Tell your mama that you love her.

The boy nodded and ran off and Beeble the Babble gathered up his crafting supplies and headed home. He'd said enough important things for the day.
