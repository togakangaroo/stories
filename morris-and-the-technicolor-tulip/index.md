# Morris and the Technicolor Tulip

Morris was a pony and he was the bravest pony in the whole kingdom.  One day, while he was grazing, an old crow sat on a nearby branch and said,

> "Morris, find the tallest mountain in the kingdom, climb it, and there you will find a tulip.  This tulip is unlike any other.  It is red and blue and purple and yellow and aquamarine all at the same time.  The petal colors pour into each other and just when your eye focuses on one, it changes beneath you.  Get this tulip,"  The old crow continued, "but do not eat its petals, for you are a pony and I know that this is what ponies are wont to do.  Bring this tulip to the King and he will grant you in return his daughter Lyuba’s hand in marriage."

This seemed like a great deal so Morris said goodbye to his mother and his father and his kickball team and bowed to his judo sensei - as was only polite to do - and set out in search of the tallest mountain in the land.

But how is a pony to find the tallest mountain?  Ponies are partially color-blind and three dimensional topographic maps had not yet been invented.

So Morris asked a field mouse: 

> "Where is the tallest mountain?"

> "How would I know?" the field mouse replied. "Every hill, every knoll is a mountain to me."

So he asked a sparrow:

> "Where is the tallest mountain?" But the sparrow replied, "How would I know? All the mountains are spots on the ground as I fly over."

So Morris the pony wandered from the top of hill to hill until, in a valley, he ran into a giantess and he asked her:

> "Where is the tallest mountain?"

And the giantess replied with only mild sarcasm.

> "Nice to meet you too.  I’m Ossa.  I do not know the answer for I am only 27’2" and below average height for a giantess, but I can help you find out."

She led him to the top of the nearest highest hill and, once there, raised him high above her head, and then he could see the tallest mountain clear as day.  So Morris thanked Ossa and, promising her riches when he was a pony prince, he galloped off.

Two days later he arrived at the mountain but, looking up, he soon realized that it was far too steep, far too craggy, for his pony hooves to handle.  So Morris knelt down and he cried for he would never know the princess nor be a prince.  Just then, the was a squeal and a woosh and a cavalcade of stones and a heavy, screaming weight fell square on poor Morris.

Now being of a particularly strong-back stock of pony, Morris was uninjured but embarrassed - he was the bravest pony in the land after all and being caught weeping just would not do.  So he quickly wiped his swollen eyes and reassured no one in particular,

> "I wasn’t crying."

> "That’s ok, I wasn’t falling," the heavy, screaming weight who turned out to be a mountain goat replied.  "My name is Saxony and I’m the world’s greatest mountain climber."

> "Hardly seems like it," said Morris, gesturing to the fallen rocks surrounding them.

> "Yes, errr, about that," Saxony started, "I would really appreciate it if you didn’t tell anyone.  After all, I’ve got a business to run.  I’m an instructor: Zenith Climbers Academy," he added seeing Morris’s questioning look.

> "How fortunate, I was just trying to get to the top of this mountain.  Teach me how and I promise I won’t tell a soul," Morris offered.

> "I don’t know," Saxony sized him up. "Your hooves are so firm and your back is so stiff."

> "I can do it," Morris assured him, "for I am the bravest pony in all the land."

> "Hmmm," Saxony smirked, "this will take far more than simple bravery."

And it surely did.  It took weeks of instruction and weeks of physical conditioning and there was a training montage where Morris finally beat Saxony in a game of mountaintop capture-the-flag, but, finally, he was ready.

His back packed and his hooves bound in canvas, and knowing all of the different knots, Morris the pony headed up the mountain.  There were many close calls, but after three grueling days, he was at the peak and face-to-face with the glorious tulip.  Just as the crow had described, it was gorgeous and multicolored and as you gazed at the yellows, they became blues and as you gazed at the blues, they became reds, and as you gazed at the reds, they became aquamarine; just like gasoline (not that the pony knew that).  And though his pony stomach wanted very much to taste the colors, he heeded the crow’s warning and refrained.

But now came the hard part, for the climb down would be twice as difficult as the climb up.  As Morris sat and pondered this, the sky darkened overhead and the sun was blocked out by a giant pterodactyl.

> "Aaargh!" cried Morris, "don’t eat me," while trying to put on his brave face.

> "Don’t worry about it," said the pterodactyl, "my diet consists mainly of fish, insects, and small animals, like lizards. I’m Terry. And yes, it’s a weird bit of alliteration; take it up with my parents," he quickly added as Morris’s brave face broke out into a grin.  "Look, it’s not like there’s such an animal as a pterodactyl anyways, it’s a misnomer applied to at least two different genuses."

> "I’m sorry," said Morris.

And he explained his dilemma.

> "Hmmm," Terry observed.  "Well, I’ll tell you what, I like to hang out at this peak and it’s not like there’s room up here for the both of us so, if you trust me, I’ll pick you up with my talons and fly you down."

> "That seems reasonable," Morris replied.

And he grabbed the tulip gently with his teeth and Terry grabbed him gently with his talons, and they set off.

But Terry had not accounted for the weight of Morris’s pony muscles and had to fly very fast to maintain the lift required to stay aeronautically stable. So fast in fact that three petals tore off of the fantastic tulip and floated away on the breeze.  And though Morris was dismayed, there was little he could do, for he was soon back on the ground and thankful for that at least.

Finally safe, Morris parted ways with Terry and it was a simple day’s trot to the King’s palace.  Once there he presented the fantastic tulip to the monarch, but the reaction was less than grand.

> "Indeed, this tulip is magnificent," the King reasoned, "but surely you did not expect me to miss the fact that it is damaged.  You came here asking for my daughter’s hand in marriage, but I can already see that you couldn’t help yourself but eat at this beautiful flower.  How could I ever trust you around my beautiful daughter Lyuba, who is my own flower after all?  Throw this insolent pony in the dungeon and throw away the key!"

Just as the royal guards swarmed around Morris there was a smash and the door burst open and the giantess Ossa burst in.  She opened up her massive fist and there, in the crease of her Saturn line, laid a multi-colored petal, orange, and green, and purple, and aquamarine, all at the same time.

> "I was just sitting to my daily meal of ground-bone porridge when this floated on the breeze and landed in my bowl," she panted.  "I remembered your story Morris, and I ran here as quickly as I could for I knew that you cannot deliver a partial flower.

Then a crash of falling glass rang out and Saxony the mountain goat rappelled from the ceiling.  He rummaged in his knapsack and when he pulled pulled out, wedged gingerly in his cloven hoof was another multi-colored petal.

> "I was climbing Mount Death-O-Nator when I spied this on a nearby ledge.  I thought of Morris and I came here right away," he explained. "I totally would have made it to the top otherwise," he added.

> "Very well," proclaimed the King, "It is good to have such friends, but I am not blind and I can see that one petal is missing still and so I still cannot trust you with my daughter."

> "But Father..."

 A new voice rang out from the throne room, and it was like music. The Princess Lyuba stepped out from behind the throne and removed her hand from her breast, and on her chest was the third multi-color petal, and she was the only thing in the room as beautiful as it.

> "I was doing my sewing this morning when this flew in through the window.  I sewed it into my dress and now I present it as evidence that Morris the Pony has been true to his word."

> "In that case," the King harrumphed, "if my daughter so desires, I approve for her and Morris to be betrothed."

She did and they did and, at the grand ceremony, everyone was there: Ossa the Giantess and Saxony the mountain goat and Terry the unfortunately named pterodactyl.  They even invited the old crow, who declined on the grounds of being afraid that Terry might eat her, but she sent a nice postcard and a set of very tasteful placemats.

So Morris and Princess Lyuba were wed and it was a little weird since he was a pony and she was a human princess, but nobody said anything so they just let it slide.
