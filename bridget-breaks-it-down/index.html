		<h1>Bridget Breaks It Down</h1>
		<aside class="for">For Laura</aside>

		<section>
<p>There were lots of animals in the forest. Terry, the titmouse tailor; Craig the carpet-cleaner caterpillar; and Bridget the fox, who wasn’t particularly fond of alliteration.</p>
<p>It was a great community and Bridget was well liked and respected as being both fun and having all her shit relatively together. “Bridget seems to have all her shit relatively together” all the other animals would say. </p>
<p>One time she was asked to perform her famous whirling-tail dance at a dinner party. It was there that she first met Benny the Bear. He was nice and smart and he worked at the bicycle shop. He came over and introduced himself.</p>
<p>They laughed and talked for hours; her giving him a hard time for his allitirativeness and him ribbing her for the time she stumbled and almost fell on her face but passed it off as a sick dance move (nice!).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
<p>Three months later, Bridget woke up feeling great. Her career was finally taking off, she had gotten a full eleven hours of sleep, and she was still seeing that cute Benny. She flung open her window to encounter a bustle like she’d never seen. All her neighbors were running about. Construction cranes were all over the place, stacking twigs, lifting stones, and one of them splitting a breakfast sandwich with the froggy foreman.</p>

<p>With nobody stopping to answer any of her questions, she cornered a tortoise in the alley behind her house.</p>
<p>“Todd! What the shit is going on here?” asked Bridget.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear?” he slowly muttered, “It’s all over the news. They’re coming.” He closed his eyes, and swallowed nervously. This took a while.</p>
<p>“Who’s coming?” Bridget demanded starting to get quite impatient. “Why is everyone freaking out?”</p>
<p>“The Russians!” Todd’s head was retracting rapidly into his shell. </p>
<p>Before she could coerce any sort of explanation, a gaggle of voices and a firm knock resounded on her front door. </p>
<p>Flinging it open, Bridget was surprised to find mayor himself - Mallory, surrounded by his many aides.</p>
<p>“Bridget” the mantis removed his top hat and was in her house before she could utter a surprised grunt. “I suppose you’ve heard.”</p>
<p>“Not quite” she stammered back in reply “Something about the Russians?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Mallory expounded quickly. “Look, our president is a bit of a dumb ass. Got onto one of those ‘anything you can do I can do better’ trains with the Premier. You know how it goes.”</p>
<p>“Maybe?” Bridget was confused.</p>
<p>”Of course you do. What you probably don’t know however, is why I’m here. In your house.” He passed a spindly arm over his companions now making themselves at home in her dining room. “With all these people.”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s not to try my cooking.” she was proud of her quick-witted response, it was very ‘Die Hard’.</p>
<p>“Certainly not,” the mantis was even quicker, “it’s terrible.”</p>
<p>He ignored Bridget’s visible indignation, “We skipped lunch in our rush to get here and have been asking around. Everyone’s in agreement on this. Your cooking is just horrid.” </p>
<p>There was an unnecessary muttering of consensus.</p>
<p>“But your dancing on the other hand, everyone agrees is sublime.”</p>
<p>Bridget experienced the biggest mood swing of her life. “But what does that...”</p>
<p>“You see,” Mallory was now leaning in and whispering, “Dance is the game! And the bastards are pretty confident they’re going to win too.”</p>
<p>One of Mallory’s companions flipped on Bridget’s television and there, on the screen, was the prettiest, most athletic white mink Bridget had ever seen. “Presenting Mila Emignova and the Moscow Ballet!” the commercial shouted in bold, stern lettering. Bridget stared slack jawed as the mink swirled and twirled, jumped and pranced, a flowing edie of shoulders, toes, and tail.</p>
<p>“I think you’ve got a pretty good chance.” Mallory stated matter-of-factly. “If you lose, they’re putting up a statue of that red squirrel Lenin in every town hall.”</p>
<p>“It’s was a weird bet.” He acknowledged. “Competition’s in six weeks” </p>
<p>And with that, her house emptied and Bridget was left alone.</p>

<p>Zasha was a bunny. Zasha was also a soviet defector. He had been a dance instructor and a physical trainer, working with many top soviet athletes, before sprinting off an airplane during a state visit, ears waving in the air, screaming “I defect! I defect!” Benny tracked him down on the internet. As fortune would have it, he had settled down to a quiet life several towns over, tending his beet garden and becoming well known in the neighborhood for his elaborate early morning lungeing routines. All physical trainers love lunges.</p>
<p>The next day Bridget gathered her bicycle and set off to visit the eccentric hoping to glean some information on how she might defeat her Russian nemesis. “At the very least I could get a borsch recipe out of this,” she reasoned.</p>
<p>Zasha met her at the gate, a cheery, old, yet incredibly fit ball of energy, he leisurely gnawed a celery stalk. Bridget thought he was adorable.</p>
<p>That lasted for another two seconds. “Zo, you iz fox who vill be champion?” He asked curtly.</p>
<p>“I can’t really say,” being taken aback was becoming a theme for Bridget. “I’m going to try my best.”</p>
<p>“I am pretty good,” she quickly added.</p>
<p>“Ve vill zee. Now qvick!” the rabbit raised his voice suddenly “Fourth pozition, triple twist and grand jete!”</p>
<p>Bridget, startled, started, stumbled, and spun on her way down to land in a surprisingly graceful split.</p>
<p>“Eczellent tombe,” she had somehow impressed him. “Good creativity, ver difficult.” He paused briefly, ”But can you vin?”</p>
<p>”Ve vill zee!” He motioned for Bridget to follow him to the house.</p>

		<section>
<p>The day was grueling. She salto’ed twirled, lifted, lunged, squatted, and helped Zasha type up an email to his grandkids. The next day she came back and did it again. And again, and again, and again. </p>
<p>“I knew Emignova you know.” Zasha frequently stared off in the distance while talking, making Bridget feel like an eavesdropper to her own conversation. “Ver young, ver lovely. She iz great danzer.She voz my student. Great lunges.”</p>
<p>He cut her off before she could inquire further. ”Fourth pozition, triple twist, and grand jete!”</p>

<p>The day was rapidly approaching. The town was abuzz.</p>
<p>The field was established around an old giant oak tree Bridget had danced around as a whelp. Bleachers were installed. The titmice knit flags of soft moss and hung them decoratively in the branches. The Russian team arrived and quickly erected an ominous steel grey training facility. News stations set up shop and network programming was a flurry of training reels and man-on-the-street interviews. Images of Mila Emignova twirling effortlessly saturated the airwaves. </p>
<p>A nutria in a sharp red suit and clutching a microphone showed up on Bridget’s doorstep.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” She asked. “They say that Emignova has been trained by the best. They say that she is unbeatable. The bookies put your odds at a thousand to one. What is going through your mind?”</p>
<p>Bridget refused to comment, kept her head down, and, just like every day, bicycled to Zasha’s to continue her training.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
<p>Finally the day was upon them. Bridget spent all morning at Zasha’s stretching and discussing strategy. Benny arrived, dressed in a suit and at the wheel of a limousine he had rented especially for the occasion. She squealed, and hugged him in joy, his peaked cap nearly knocked off by her bushy tail as it wound around his body. Yet when she turned to Zasha to help him into the back seat he just shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>“Zis is not for me,” the old bunny’s terse tone pre-empted any objection. “You hav been trained. You are ready. You go. I cannot.” With an impressive leap for someone of his age he was in the house, slammed the door, and was gone from sight.</p>
<p>Bridget was crushed. Sure what he had said was technically true. And sure she would have the support of Benny, her parents, her friends, Karen from 3rd grade who just messaged her on facebook, and indeed Mallory, the town, and the whole nation, but Zasha, her mentor and trainer, the one she wanted most to witness what she could achieve would not be there. She squeezed her fists nervously as Benny pulled into the complex, trying to focus her mind and ready herself for the competition of her life.</p>

<p>This was the first time she had seen Emignova in real life. The mink was gorgeous as they approached the judges` table (owls, of course), she was tall and slinky and walked like dance was all she could do. An intimidated Bridget barely heard the rules of the competition. Three rounds of one head-to-head dance each, best of three wins. A brief, mutual curtsy, and the dancers retired to their respective dressing rooms.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
<p>Bridget was up first. As the first few chords of <em class="title">Hit Me Baby One More Time</em> filtered through the sound system, the crowd erupted. Captured by their enthusiasm Bridget bounded onto the stage with a renewed confidence. She hopped and bounced around the old oak tree, allegro and jazz hands, her tail moving one way as she moved the other. It was without a doubt the best dancing of her life and as the last “I’m not that innocent” waned she found herself panting, arms raised to the sky with her parents, friends, Karen, and the rest all roaring their approbation.</p>
<p>Emignova was next. She seemed a bit unsure as she stepped into the clearing. As <em class="title">I’m a Genie In a Bottle</em> picked up steam, and despite the crowd’s boos and hisses, she started to hit her stride. A jump, a twirl, a knee-slap, Bridget was impressed. However, in the middle of a perfect belly roll - disaster! Stepping a bit too close to the oak tree the mink caught her foot on a protruding root and collapsed to the ground. The crowd jeered gleefully, and she could not recover in time. The judges conferred for just a single minute.</p>
<p>“Bridget Wins!” Any feelings of empathy for the Russian quickly dissipated amidst her glee.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
<p>The intermission was a blur for Bridget. Things were going better than she could have possibly hoped. Without her trainer, head to head with one of the best dancers in the world, and yet she was winning!	</p>
<p>Her optimism proved premature however as Emignova started the next round. With Tchaikovsky on the sound system, she came out like a whirling dervish. Bridget’s heart sank as the Russian dancer attacked the oak tree directly. She leaped and saltoed, jumping purposely from root to root without ever touching ground. Flips and vaults, she finished in a tireless spin. Even the hostile crowd was moved to grudging applause.</p>
<p>Bridget stepped out far less sure of herself than she had been just twenty minutes ago. Reeling from what she had just seen, her heart was simply not into <em class="title">Pachelbel’s Canon</em>. She whirled well and gyrated competently. She ballon’ed to the beat. But all her doubts had returned. What did she think she was doing? She was good, but not this good. Even her mentor didn’t bother to show up.</p>
<p>Bridget ended her routine enfolded. There was again little contest as the judges conferred, but this time, the vote was not in her favor. </p>
<p>“Mila Emignova!” The match was tied.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
<p>Intermission again, a fazed Bridget headed with her thoughts back to the greenroom. It was simple really, if her competition could do what she had just witnessed there was no chance. And why should there be? Bridget had trained for six weeks, Emignova had been training her whole life. One more round might remain but it was all over.</p>
<p>“Benny!” Bridget’s melancholia was interrupted as she entered the dressing room to find the bear a mess. His eye puffy, covered in scratches and bruises, he slumped, breathing heavily, in the corner.</p>
<p>“What did they do to you!?” Bridget rushed over to him.</p>
<p>“Zey? It waz juzt ze one!” Bridget spun around to Zasha, swaddled in duct tape but otherwise looking none the worse for wear. “Zis beast azzaulted me!”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t stand it.” Benny offered his defense haltingly. “I saw how upset you were and...”</p>
<p>“And he vould not take no vor an anzwer.” The bunny fumed as Bridget hurried to unbind him.</p>
<p>“For a tiny old guy he sure packs a wallop. But,”  Benny directed his good eye at the rabbit, “he really should be here.”</p>
<p>“Ztupid bear,” Zasha’s ire was not decreasing, “ov courze I vont to, but zer are reazons you don’t...”</p>
<p>He choked back the remainder of the sentence as with a flurry Mila Emignova passed into the room.</p>
<p>“I vant to wish you good luck.” Her voice was soft, understated, with only the slightest accent. Bridget wondered how she had never heard it before. “You are great dancer. You should not be discouraged...” Mila’s eyes landed on the cony rabbit. “Zasha..”</p>
<p>“Milachka.”</p>
<p>They stared at each other for what seemed like minutes.</p>
<p>Emignova broke the tension first “What are you doing here?” she screamed. “Vhere have you been!?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t..” </p>
<p>She did not let him finish. “You ver a father to me! And you left! You left and you didn’t come back! You didn’t even say good bye!”</p>
<p>“You don’t underztand.” Zasha’s eyes were glued to the floor. “I vanted very much to zay goot bye. I vanted not to leave. I had to. I owed money. Much money, I had uzed to ztart my training zenter. And zey ver coming for me. ”</p>
<p>His pleading gaze met hers for the first time. “I’m zorry Milachka. If zey knew how much I cared, zey vould have uzed you to get to me. You ver a daughter to me too. Pleaze, pleaze. Forgive me.”</p>
<p>“I...I don’t know.” Her speech was halted through her tears. “Maybe in...” Mila was overcome with emotion. She turned and fled the room with just a sympathetic “Good luck!” to Bridget as she rushed by.</p>

<p>“Dancers to the field!” The omnipresent speakers boomed.</p>
<p>Bridget took no notice. “Zasha,” she crouched, “are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Yez,” the rabbit was sniffling quietly. “Yez I am fine. You know, zis is bezt. I juzt...it zo hard.” He sobbed once more, gathered himself, and the old disciplinarian was back.</p>
<p>“And you. You hav to do zomething hard as vell.” His steely eye fixed on Bridget. “You zink you hav less practize but I have zeen you. You are great danzer. Good creativity. Ver difficult. Now go and vin.”</p>
<p>Bridget gathered her breath, and, hearing the first few notes of <em class="title">Burning Love</em> over the loudspeaker, she put thoughts of Mila, of Zasha, of town hall statues, and of Benny’s black eye, out of mind, and lunged onto the field.</p>
<p>She had never danced like this before. Bridget dug deep down. Down to her childhood, dancing around this same oak tree. Back to before she has to worry about moves and turns and positions, back to the joy of purely moving to the music. She turned, hopped, and jived. She jitterbugged and two-stepped. She did a backflip. She embodied the song. She was a-hunk-a-hunk-a-hunk of burning love. Her fans approved, up on their feet hooting and hollering as Elvis sang the last verse. The cheering so loud, so pervasive, it took minutes for the arena to quiet down.</p>
<p>Now it was the Russian’s turn. Bridget exhaled anxiously. It was out of her hands.</p>
<p>Emignova stood still through the intro of The Beach Boys’ <em class="title">Sloop John B</em>. Scanning the audience her eyes met Zasha’s, then, never losing eye contact for more than a split second...</p>
<p>She took fourth position, triple twirled, and grand jete’ed. And again. And again, and again. She repeated the simple motions over and over for the duration of the song. The crowd was livid, the newsmen already chattering about the “breakdown”. And as the tune faded, unaffected by the chorus of boos, she smiled at her old master, nodded to Bridget, and with a flutter of her bushy tail, exited stage left.</p>
<p>“The winner by unanimous decision - Bridget the Fox!”</p>
<p>The crowd erupted. Cheers! Fanfare! Someone brought a vuvuzela! Bridget was swamped by a sea of microphones and cameras. Not only had she defeated one of the greatest dancers alive, but she had saved the town! How did she feel? What was going through her mind? Was she going to Disneyland? Did she know that Morris the Pony prince was watching? He loved it.</p>

		<section>
<p>As soon as she could, Bridget pushed her way into her dressing room. There was Zasha and Benny, and her parents, and friends, and also Karen got in there somehow. These were who she wanted to celebrate with.</p>
<p>“Three cheers for Bridget!”</p>
<p>“Huzzah!”</p>
<p>“Huzzah!”</p>
<p>“Huzzah!”</p>
<p>Then Benny stepped forward.</p>

<blockquote>You are amazing. I love you more every single day. I love hugging you, I love watching you dance and I love watching you sleep. You are a happy person and you make me even happier.There is no one I want to spend my life with more. I have one simple question to ask you...</blockquote>
